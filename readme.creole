= Page2Docbook =

A Trac plugin to export wiki pages as docbook documents.

This plugin used to lived at http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/Page2DocbookPlugin

That is still where to get the latest egg (0.6.3).

== Installation ==

This plugin was tested with Trac versions 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12.
Please ensure the following python modules are installed before installing this plugin:
 * python-uTidyLib (note: if you're using a 64bit OS, you may need [[https://github.com/lachlan-00/utidylib2 | this fork ]], or more specifically, this [[http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=14691&group_id=1810 | this patch]]).
 * python-libxml2
 * python-libxslt

Refer to the [[http://trac.edgewall.org/search?q=TracPlugins | Trac plugin documentation]] for details on how to build and install plugins and macros.

After installing, a new alternative format should appear on the bottom of each wiki page, next to the "Plain Text" link.

== Companion Script ==

There's a [[https://github.com/filipefigcorreia/page2docbookplugin/page-retriever/getDocbookDocuments.py | companion python script]] that retrieves all the docbook files for a given set of wiki pages. It saves the docbook files to the local computer, along with any attached image file, making them ready for processing with [[http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookPublishingTools | any other tool that receives docbook as input]].

This script is currently mostly undocumented, but I believe it is simple enough to be easily understood.
